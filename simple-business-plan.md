## Opportunity

*Knowledge* is an abstract concept. We even can’t define what *knowledge* is, but we know its importance. As humans, we survived and our civilization thrived, because we transformed *data* into *useful, meaningful information* and applied it; which resulted in an enormous heritage of knowledge. 

### Problem

**Knowledge production, representation, discovery, acquisition, spread is inefficient and ineffective.**

- We use mostly the Internet to exchange information for two decades. Web gives us a big opportunity of global connectivity but we still use documents to embed information into text; structure, store and share our knowledge. 

  This is why it is still inefficient & ineffective to acquire knowledge from the web. 

  - The rise of app era (Web 2.0) only created a market for big data and surveillance which global technopolies dominate. There is no specific medium focused on knowledge.

- It is hard to evaluate information *— because it is an ambiguous concept.* We can't know whether a specific information is true, how much important, has a source or is related to another information.

See [Appendix](#appendix), where we details about *the problem*.

### Solution

- We will find a better way for knowledge representation and expression.
- We will create a medium for social knowledge exchange, to test our methods and experiment on human
- We will create a universal knowledge resource that anyone can discover, acquire, and exchange true, useful and meaningful information.
  - Our most ambitious goal is to make this like a search engine where search results would be pure information pieces related to each other, gathered from the whole heritage of human knowledge, not web pages.
    - This requires a better way for knowledge representation/expression.
    - Internet surfers wouldn't have to read a document to find a specific specific information. 

### Outcome

### Target Market

**`TAM` :** Everyone.

> Because information is crucial and a desperate need for any human-being to help them continue their lives.

[^TAM]: Total Available Market

**`SAM` :** People who consume, create, exchange information digitally.

[^SAM]: Segmented Available Market

**`SOM` :** People who use social media to share what they know, or who like to consume "knowledgable" content.

[^SOM]: Share Of the Market

#### Competition

- *Google, Facebook, Twitter, Wikipedia, …*

  Search engines, social media platforms, blogs, news and article websites. Any conventional platform where people get informed.

### Problem — in-depth

> Bugün en büyük entelektüel tüketimi webden yapıyoruz. Sosyal medya, arama motoru ve içerik websiteleri. Bu üçlü arasında zıplayıp duruyoruz. Matbaadan sonra büyük bir sıçrama olsa da yaptığımız sadece yazılı metinleri dijitalize etmek oldu.
>
> Internet bize bilgiye erişim olanakları açısından çok fayda sağladı. Ama günümüzde bu olumlu etkisi giderek azalıyor. Odağımızı kaybettik. Büyük bir veri bombardımanı altındayız ve odaklanamıyoruz. En değerli veriyi seçip, süzüp, yorumlayarak işe yarar ve anlamlı bilgi üretemiyoruz. Bu nedenle piramitte bir türlü "bilgelik" basamağına ulaşamıyoruz.

> Sorunumuzun temelinde birkaç neden yatıyor:

#### Perception of Knowledge

- We can’t define what *knowledge* is.
  - *Knowledge* is an abstract concept. It is a great power that we can’t define, measure and concretely express; so which becomes wasted. And yet, we know how important *knowledge* is for our civilization. As humans, we survived and thrived just because we transformed *data* into *useful, meaningful knowledge*.
- It is hard to...

  - evaluate information *— because it is an ambiguous concept.*
  - know whether a specific information…
    - is true.
    - is important.
    - has a source.
    - is related to another information in a definitive way.

#### Knowledge Acquisition

- It is inefficient to get information from the web.
  - Web is document based.
    - We express and preserve our knowledge, feelings and thoughts in the form of monolithic text documents. Even if this made a revolution and contributed to our civilization through thousands of years, it also brings many limitations.
  - Characteristics of web documents that we use for gathering information:
    - subjective, long textual documents with language-dependent meaning, obscure context; full of ads, content which is optimized for search engines, NOT humans.

Knowledge is significant, but in the eyes of human, it is a too abstract, thus ambiguous concept. In this case, an objective expression and measurement is necessary. For example, we can measure the value of assets with money (and currencies), but we can't do the same with the value of information.

So we need to **<u>liberate the knowledge</u>**.

##### So we propose this:

- Information should be expressed and represented with "pieces".
  - The pieces that we would express the information should has these attributes:
    - independent
    - verifiable (both true and correct)
    - organized
    - objective
    - collective
    - concrete
    - interrelated
    - useful (e.g. reusable, exchangeable as money)
    - universal
    - meaningful
- With this way, we can...
  - understand the importance of an information.
  - see the relationships between those information pieces.
  - measure the correctness of an information, because we can find also its source.
  - create the universal knowledge resource.

#### No Specific Medium for Knowledge

- There is no such platform...

  - for preserving the heritage of knowledge, feelings and thoughts of humanity.
  - where people can acquire knowledge by exchanging information with each other.
  - specific for knowledge creation and consumption.
  - where people can express and exchange knowledge as collectively organized, interrelated information pieces.
