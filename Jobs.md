We **debate, decide then commit.** We move fast and stay lean, but act with purpose. 
We bring intent and insight to every work we do. 
We know we won't always get it right, but we are not afraid to learn from experiences.

### Seems like demanding job descriptions, why? 

#### Why would you do it?

- Because you need a <u>purpose</u> in your life. **Because you want do something that matters!**
  - Working a 9-5 job, in a large team, detached by the effects of your efforts sounds awful to you.
- Because you understand that <u>assuming responsibility is the only way to grow and develop yourself</u>. 
  - Muscles don’t grow while you watch sitcoms and chill on your sofa, but through the pain and sweat in the gym. The same is true for your career and your life.
- Because you will be part of an awesome team of diverse top-performing individuals. 
  - You understand that an entourage of self-driven people is the best gift for your future.
- Because you know to <u>never surrender an opportunity for short-term security</u>.
  - You can always get a cozy secure job, but an opportunity to join the revolution of our time is rare.

### What we are looking for…

These are the type of jobs where you are pushed in cold water and you have to learn to swim by yourself. 
Your personality and your traits matter as much as your tech expertise.

- We are looking for an **independent**, **responsible person**. Mainly because there is no time for micro-management. 
  - We expect you to be able to carry your own weight and be a reliable partner.
- We are looking for a **fast learner**.
  - We may need to use technologies that you never used before. 
    That should not scare, but excite you. 
  - In most cases we may not even know what we need and you may have to propose something.
- We are looking for you to get **stuff done**.
  - We work in weekly sprints because we believe in consistent delivery over big lengthy releases.
- We want you to be **proactive**. We appreciate conviction way more than consensus. 
  - Words are nice, opinions are cute … but proactivity in action is golden.
- We want you to be an **over-communicator**.
  - People here work remote and it’s up to you to show your work, explain your ideas or highlight problems
- We want you to be **a partner for your colleagues in the squad**. 
  - Help or lead the planning process etc. 
    Provide guidance and help your colleagues when they get stuck.

### We are a small team, so…

  Every day is a struggle, but we keep an eye on the prize. We are passionate about helping people learn and improve themselves and that’s what keeps us going.
- **We find a way or a make a way.**
  We focus on difficult problems and need to solve them, for the future of mankind.
- **We thrive in uncertainty, as we have more questions than answers.** 
  Not problems, but opportunities to learn new things.

### Benefits

- **Be an early "workmate".**

- Potential for **stock options** package.

### Our tech stack

We love open source. If we need a tool, first we make a research, see what's been done in the open source world. Then tailor the existing solutions and create our own solution. 

#### This sounds hard at first, but it works!

- It makes the product development a lot easier, faster and efficient. 
- We have full control & awareness on our tools, know how they work and would behave.
- We contribute to the open source community.

#### Back-end

#### Front-end

- **JavaScript** — Lucid, Luckt, Sage.
- **PWA** technology.
  - For cross-platform support. We want to provide the same experience for everyone.

## Product Manager

### What will you be doing?

You will take charge of the product planning and execution. You will be working closely with the founders to define and express the vision through the products we put out. You will collaborate with UX to craft a kick-ass user experience across mediums and with engineers to ship it. You will measure our success and failures.

You will represent our users and do everything in your power to help them become successful. We are here to help you make them rock-stars.

#### **That means :**

- You will build and maintain a prioritized roadmap. You will be transparent throughout the process and collaborate with all stakeholders to build consensus.
- You will need to make lots of decisions. We expect you to come up with the right point of view, even if that’s unpopular. Your role is to help us build consensus not be ruled by it. We appreciate conviction.
- You will document each mission. In great detail. Focus on corner-cases. Propose and track success metrics for each of them.
- You will need to communicate your decisions and plans. You have to be a pillar of clarity, even if you have a ton of questions yourself.

- You will research products that could be perceived as competition. You will keep an eye on new shiny solutions to problems we are also struggling with. You will know the trends that could become opportunities for us.


There are probably things that are missing that will show up as we go.

### Skills

- You need to have demonstrated success defining and launching excellent products. You either worked as a product manager in a bigger company or played a generalist role in a startup.
- You need to recognize good design when you see it. You need to know enough about software development to recognize what developers are talking about. You will be a Jack of all trades.
- You need to be very well organized. Attention to detail is something that matters a lot here.
- You need to be familiar with agile product development.
- Your communication skills, especially in writing, should be top notch. You will be required to document use-cases, interviews etc and to evangelize your work internally and externally.
- It’s a plus if you are a user of our service.

We are a small but Agile (with a capital A) team. We move fast and try different things all the time. Your job is to make sure that there is a method to the chaos and that we don’t ignore the basics.

#### What will you be doing?

We are looking for a self-driven growth hacker and a marketing specialist to help develop and scale our user acquisition campaigns and tactically grow Dorkodu's web apps.

We are firm believers in organic growth as that’s the only scalable way high-growth can be achieved.

- Jumpstart, boost and uplift every other growth effort we are involved in.
- Being in a new category of product (knowledge discovery), continuously test how we describe ourselves and learn how to push forward our point of view.


You will oversee all performance marketing activities and will work with the rest of the company (Product, Growth, Engineering, Business etc.) to create and run highly targeted tactical campaigns from beginning to end (strategy, planning, execution, budgeting and optimization) across multiple channels.

#### This means…

- Drive campaigns from planning to execution and beyond, to meet key performance metrics.

- Collaborate with the design and growth teams to guide A/B creative tests and spend-scaling tests on campaigns, to identify what works best.

  - Generating ad creatives on your own and being able to fully deliver a paid campaign from start to finish is something we value.

### Skills…

- Experience with design products for ad creatives.
- Knowledge of Amplitude, Branch, Google Analytics and in general, the mobile paid advertising ecosystem (such as app campaigns, deeplinks, attribution).
