## Collection of Information As Part of Using Wanderlyf Service

In addition to the information that you provide to us when you register for a user account, we collect information about the URLs, titles and content of the web pages and other information you save to Deepstash. The types of information we collect includes your browser type, device type, time zone, language, and other information related to the manner in which you access the Deepstash Technologies. We also collect information about your use of the Deepstash Technologies so that we can provide our services.

USE OF COOKIES AND ANALYTICS

In addition to the methods described above, we may also collect information using cookies or other technologies when you access our website or use Deepstash Technologies. You may decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features, you may be required to enter your password more frequently during a session, and you may be unable to install or use certain Deepstash Technologies. Cookies and other technologies make our Deepstash Technologies easier to use and help us customize and personalize the services we provide based on your interests and activities.

USE OF INFORMATION

We use your personal information to respond to your requests and perform our contract with you. We may do this, for example, by using your contact information to respond to your inquiries, to provide customer support and to supply any products or services you have requested. In addition, if you choose to use the Deepstash Technologies to share content with another person, we will use the recipient's email address or user account information to provide that service, but we will not use that email address for any other purpose.

SHARING OF INFORMATION

Public content

If you choose to make the content you save publicly available, we may share that information with others in accordance with the options you select. In addition, if you choose to use the Deepstash Technologies to share articles, videos, or other content with another person, we will send an email on your behalf to that person with a link to the content that you have chosen to share.

Working with third parties

We may work with trusted third parties to facilitate one or more aspects of the products and services that we provide to you and to conduct research related to Internet usage, and we may provide some of your personal information directly to these third parties. For example, as discussed above, we may use a third party payment processor to process payments for our paid subscription service. We may also share your device ID in working with third parties who assist us in delivering advertisements to you. These parties are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide to them for any other purpose other than those discussed above, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.

Sharing as required by law or asset sale

In the event that we or certain of our assets are acquired, user information may be included among the transferred assets.

Although we strive to protect the personal information of our users, we will release personal information if required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary. We follow the law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We will notify you when we are asked to hand over your personally identifiable information in this way unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we will only release your personally identifiable information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary or appropriate under applicable law. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.

KEEPING INFORMATION

We will keep your information only for as long as we need it to provide you services, manage our business or as required by law or contract.

TRANSFER OF INFORMATION

We're a global organization and our computers are in several different places around the world. We also use service providers whose computers may also be in various countries. This means that your information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.

SECURITY

We have agreements with third parties and have adopted other security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control or under the control of our service providers. Your personally identifiable information is protected by utilizing both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted physical access to the places where your information is stored. Although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain free from security issues. In the event of a security breach involving your personal information, we will make any legally required disclosures to you in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the legitimate interests of law enforcement, or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

CHILD PROTECTION

We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will purge any information we receive from our database and cancel the corresponding accounts, if we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information by email or otherwise, please contact us so that we will be able to do the necessary actions.

Our product is intended for general use and has no restrictions on utilization by children. Deepstash DOES NOT contain any hazardous, violent or any other content (e.g. augment reality) that may require parental supervision.

PHISHING

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Deepstash. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your username, password, credit card information or national identification number in an unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s website.

AMENDMENTS TO POLICY

Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on our Website that you can access at [deepstash.com](https://deepstash.com/) or through the options or help menu of the Deepstash application. All amended terms shall automatically be effective thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the Website. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy that affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Website notifying users that our Privacy Policy has changed. Our use of your information shall be governed by the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy in effect when you first use our application or thirty (30) after the terms are changed, as explained above.
