# Monetization

## Methods

### Content Curation

- Businesses can also take advantage of **content curation** even though this trend has not picked up pace yet. 

  The majority of businesses are discovering that connecting with users on common values and associating with ideas, rather than aggressive advertising is the way forward and an app like ours seems to be like the perfect match.

- But even outside of the pure promotion, there are tangible internal benefits such as for example onboard employees, and designing new methods of passing information around the organization. 

- In other words, <u>content curation apps and platforms can make the information flow in a company more useful and get the desired engagement from the workforce.</u> 

> In order for this to happen, however, information has to be shorter, actionable, and social, and have less of the characteristics of an old-school document management system.

### Advertising

Because most of the information is being monetized through advertising, the quality and the usefulness of the content for the consumer is oftentimes irrelevant in the equation. 

When people are reading an article online that makes them unsatisfied or unhappy, the publisher still gets the advertising revenue that the userâ€™s click has generated. 

The current inability to match the desires of the content consumer with the suppliers might change with technologies like blockchain and micropayments, that will make incentives better aligned.
