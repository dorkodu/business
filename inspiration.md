welcome!
liberate the human with meaningful technology.

dorkodu is a humane technology company.

we combine gamification, human-centric design with our superior technology and create products that 

we are a community of artists, who doesn’t just paint, write poems or play notes. we create products and technology to make the world actually a better place. not just by communicating our opinions through our artwork, but we walk towards our utopia by doing something impactful and inspirational.

**our purpose:** liberate the human with meaningful technology.

## on pink floyd 🌑 🌈 △ 🧱

dorkodu is the pink floyd of technology.

they saw the dark side of human, and illuminated that darkness.
and showed us there is a light shines bright. a light of hope.

we can see this black & white world in color.
all we need is that pure, geniune white light and a prism.
that prism, is technology. just a tool that helped human civilization dawn.
we will give you that.
and if you can remember who you are,
we can together turn this dark, void, senseless scene,
into a marvelous rainbow.

dorkodu represents a higher ideal of technology and art.

we create *the dorkodu way*, which encompasses *emotion* and *expression*
which captures the *attitude*, *vibe* and the *energy* of an *authentic* **human experience**.

---

there is something going in this world,
that makes people want to be poets instead of bankers.

> we’re here to put the humane spirit into the products and technology again.
> **— dorkodu**

driven by feelings, nothing plastic.
those old colors are all dead.
we want none of it.
