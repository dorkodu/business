# About

## Good Ideas Matter

Deepstash helps you become more inspired, wiser and productive,
through bite-sized ideas. Curated by a community of smart people like you.

## Our core belief

### Ideas are fundamental

If we evolve our biology through genes, it's what we hold in our brains that help shape our lives and improve the world around us. **Ideas represent the building blocks of the modern world, informing our thinking and behavior every day.** New ideas breathe fresh life into how we view the world & we depend on new ideas to improve our health, productivity or our relationships.

Ideas used to be reserved for the rich and powerful who had access to knowledge. Whether the king or the priest, it was those at the top that control information. With the advent of the Internet, the pendulum has swing the other side. We have so much access to information that it becomes overwhelming. There is too much to absorb and not enough time. Not to mention the socially enabled magical devices we carry in our pockets can keep our minds constantly distracted with divisive news & silly entertainment.

**Deepstash is a platform for finding and organising the ideas that matter to you.** We are a passionate community obsessed with finding the Aha moments in all the content we are consuming. We are condensing all our insights into ideas that we share with all the other stashes who are sharing our passion. It's what we call stashing!

## A closer look

### How does it work?

In Deepstash you find ideas on topics that interest you. These ideas are represented as little cards you can read at a glance. All ideas have a source: a book, an article, a podcast etc. And they are curated by a people like you. Now with that in mind, here are the basics:

- Opening the app you'll see **the feed**: a list of ideas that match your interests or come from stashers you follow.

- Tapping on any idea will show you all the related ideas curated by the same author from that article or book.

- Building the good habit of reading every day and constantly nurturing your mind is easy with Deepstash.

- You can set a daily reading goal and maintain a reading streak.

- **Publish** your own ideas once you are ready.

- Don't let ideas you stumble upon go to waste.

- When you find an idea you like stash it. This will add it to a collection we call a stash. You can find your collections on your profile.

- **Your profile** tells your Deepstash story.

  The ideas you stashed, your passions or preferences live on your profile.

### A Brave New Format

#### What are ideas?

Deepstash operates with ideas, short notes that are condensing profound thoughts into simple sentences. They could be inspiring quotes, sharable stories, practical tips for any area of life. Think of ideas like Lego bricks for your mind, small & fun pieces that you can pull out whenever you need them and stack them together to create amazing new things. Ideas are:

- **Atomic**: one idea per concept.
- **Short**: good ideas are as condensed as possible but not more.
- **Self-contained**: good ideas should have value on their own.

There are not a lot of strict rules to how ideas are made. But we have noticed some tips and tricks that successful stashers use.

### Sharing is caring

#### Join the Curators

We read with a pen. We stash ideas by highlighting the ideas that jump to us. And then we borrow from one another. Because sharing is caring.

### Be bright. Be you.

Great Product. Happy Customers. It all starts with the right team, which in turn starts with awesome people. We are looking for **ambitious**, **self-driven individuals**, who are **passionate** about the problem we are working on.

We don’t have a schedule. You can contribute when you feel you are most productive. And most of the team is remote. That has some advantages but it comes with responsibilities:

- #### Take ownership

  - We step up and get stuff done. We all know that things will not happen unless we work for it. There are tons of projects that need to get done and we all apply our skills to advance them.

    #### 

- #### Show your work

  - Results matter more than anything. We let the work do the talking most of the time.

- #### Act with urgency

  - We’re focused on making quick decisions and executing fast. “How can this be done sooner?” is the mantra which we live by.

- #### Over-communicate

  - We speak up & have no patience for silent disagreements. We prefer healthy debates. And we all let our colleagues know what goes through our minds.

### Founder Story

Vladimir Oane has always believed a curious mind and an organised stash of notes is the key to success.

When reading books, he underlined the best parts; when scanning articles, he bookmarked his favourites; when listening to podcasts, he took notes on random pieces of paper. But Vladimir’s ideas were scattered and messy. He needed a platform to consolidate them all, in an effective and collaborative way.

So, he set to work. With the help of two childhood friends (Dan and Cristian), they created Deepstash, the social network where users or ‘stashers’ can publish, organise or even share bite-sized ideas from the best sources. The community experience is alive and kicking, with over 1 million users reading and stashing around their interests.

### Elevator Pitch

Deepstash is a social network for content curation.

Our mission is to provide users with a micro-reading platform that focuses on finding and sharing good ideas, fast.

The app makes it easy to read, organise, and even create your own stashes (collection of ideas) from content you are interested in.

We view books, articles, videos, and podcasts as treasure; dig in, discover, and curate.

We are passionate about our mission and have already inspired millions of ‘stashers’ to learn more and live better.

It’s time to focus on what matters.
