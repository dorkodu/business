## About Us

We want Dorkodu to be the foundation that will change the destiny of human civilization. 
So we need extraordinary, passionate and hard-working people to pursue this goal.

### Why Dorkodu?

Dorkodu is a startup based in <u>Istanbul</u>. 
We believe that Dorkodu has the potential to help billions of people across the globe to get wiser. 
We create awesome products pursue our mission. 
We started off as a small team, but now we're growing rapidly.

> At Dorkodu, our strategy is simple. We hire the **most knowledgable and passionate** people we can find.

- **<u>Anyone who joins now can see the future before even others can dream about it.</u>**
- We place great emphasis on maintaining a humble and intellectually honest environment 
  where everyone's opinion is respected and people's contributions are acknowledged and rewarded.

### Our Work Culture

Our iterative work process helps us to think better, create better. 
We can achieve faster without trading off quality.
We **debate, decide then commit.** We move fast and stay lean, but act with purpose. 
We bring intent and insight to every work we do. 
We know we won't always get it right, but we are not afraid to learn from experiences.

### Seems like demanding job descriptions, why? 

#### Why would you do it?

- Because you need a <u>purpose</u> in your life. **<u>Because you want do something that matters!</u>**
  - Working a 9-5 job, in a large team, detached by the effects of your efforts sounds awful to you.
- Because you understand that <u>**assuming responsibility is the only way to grow and develop yourself**</u>. 
  - You don’t grow while you watch sitcoms and chill on your sofa. This is true for both your career and your life.
- Because you will <u>**be a part of an awesome team of diverse top-performing individuals**</u>. 
  - You understand that an entourage of self-driven people is the best gift for your future.
- Because you know to <u>**never surrender an opportunity for short-term security**</u>.
  - You can always get a cozy secure job, but an opportunity to join the revolution of our time is rare.

### What we are looking for…

These are the type of jobs where you are pushed in cold water and you have to learn to swim by yourself. 
Your personality and your traits matter as much as your tech expertise.

- We are looking for an **independent**, **responsible person**.
  - We expect you to be able to carry your own weight and be a reliable partner.
  - Mainly because there is no time for micro-management. 
- We are looking for a **fast learner**.
  - We may need to use methods or technologies that you never used before. 
    That should not scare, but excite you.
  - In most cases we may not even know what we need and you may have to propose something.
- We are looking for you to **get stuff done**.
  - We work in weekly sprints because we believe in consistent delivery over big lengthy releases.
- We want you to be **proactive**.
  -  We appreciate conviction way more than consensus. 
  - Words are nice, opinions are cute… but proactivity in action is golden.
- We want you to be a **good communicator**.
  - We work remote and it’s up to you to show your work, explain your ideas or highlight problems.

### We are a small team, so…

- #### **Passion for the problem is our *nitro*.**
  
  Every day is a struggle, but we keep an eye on the prize. We are passionate about helping people learn and improve themselves and that’s what keeps us going.
- #### **We find a way or a make a way.**
  
  We focus on difficult problems and need to solve them, for the future of mankind.
- #### **We thrive in uncertainty, as we have more questions than answers.**
  
  Not problems, but opportunities to learn new things.

### Benefits

- **Be an early "workmate".**
  - Join our high-growth startup to learn new skills and fast track your career growth.
  - **Grow to be a company leader in the future.**
    Get management opportunities and run your own team, even your own project.
- **You can make your own schedule.**
  - *(As long as things happen on time and on spec.)*
- **Remote-first:** We don’t care when and where you work from.
- Potential for **stock options** package.

### Our tech stack

We love open source. If we need a tool, first we make a research, see what's been done in the open source world. 
Then tailor the existing solutions and create our own tools, methods and technologies.

#### This sounds hard at first, but it works!

- It makes the product development a lot easier, faster and efficient. 
- We have full control & awareness on our tools, know how they work and would behave.
- We contribute to the open source community.

#### Back-end

- **Node** — application, TypeScript 
- **MySQL, SQLite** — persistence
- **KeyDB** — caching

#### Front-end

- **React**
- **JavaScript** — Lucid, Luckt, Sage.
- **PWA** technology.
  - We want to provide the same experience for everyone. This is the reason we chose to go PWA-only for cross-platform support. We don't want to release mobile apps to stores, because we don't want our product to be controlled by technopolies.

## Product Manager

*Worldwide* • Product

### What will you be doing?

You will take charge of the product planning and execution. You will be working closely with the founders to define and express the vision through the products we put out. You will collaborate with UX to craft a kick-ass user experience across mediums and with engineers to ship it. You will measure our success and failures.

You will represent our users and do everything in your power to help them become successful. We are here to help you make them rock-stars

#### **That means…**

- You will build and maintain a prioritized roadmap. You will be transparent throughout the process and collaborate with all stakeholders to build consensus.
- You will need to make lots of decisions. We expect you to come up with the right point of view, even if that’s unpopular. Your role is to help us build consensus not be ruled by it. We appreciate conviction.
- You will document each mission. In great detail. Focus on corner-cases. Propose and track success metrics for each of them.
- You will need to communicate your decisions and plans. You have to be a pillar of clarity, even if you have a ton of questions yourself.
- You will build and own the creative process of generating, developing, and curating new ideas. These ideas will come from users, from your colleagues and your research and intuition.
- You will have a process to keep everything in sync so that we maintain a high pace.
- You will be a steward of quality. Work with devs and QA to make sure we are shipping bug-free beautiful experiences.
- You will keep an eye on our metrics. Drill through the data. Make sure we are achieving our targets and find insights that could drive innovative initiatives. We practice evidence-based decision-making and we expect to see this from you too.
- You will research products that could be perceived as competition. You will keep an eye on new shiny solutions to problems we are also struggling with. You will know the trends that could become opportunities for us.


There are probably things that are missing that will show up as we go.

### Skills

- You need to have demonstrated success defining and launching excellent products. You either worked as a product manager in a bigger company or played a generalist role in a startup.
- You need to recognize good design when you see it. You need to know enough about software development to recognize what developers are talking about. You will be a Jack of all trades.
- You need to be very well organized. Attention to detail is something that matters a lot here.
- You need to be familiar with agile product development.
- Your communication skills, especially in writing, should be top notch. You will be required to document use-cases, interviews etc and to evangelize your work internally and externally.
- It’s a plus if you are a user of our service.

## Growth Hacker

*Worldwide* • Business — *Growth*

Dorkodu aims to improve people's life with knowledge discovery. We make it easy to find, collect and organize information & ideas you're interested in. We are a content-based consumer (B2C) product that is temporarily on a 100% free business model (subscription-free and ad-free).

We are a small but Agile (with a capital A) team. We move fast and try different things all the time. Your job is to make sure that there is a method to the chaos and that we don’t ignore the basics.

#### What will you be doing?

We are looking for a self-driven growth hacker and a marketing specialist to help develop and scale our user acquisition campaigns and tactically grow Dorkodu's web apps.

We are firm believers in organic growth as that’s the only scalable way high-growth can be achieved.

- Jumpstart, boost and uplift every other growth effort we are involved in.
- Being in a new category of product (knowledge discovery), continuously test how we describe ourselves and learn how to push forward our point of view.


You will oversee all performance marketing activities and will work with the rest of the company (Product, Growth, Engineering, Business etc.) to create and run highly targeted tactical campaigns from beginning to end (strategy, planning, execution, budgeting and optimization) across multiple channels.

#### This means…

- Drive campaigns from planning to execution and beyond, to meet key performance metrics.
- Develop an advertising growth model that we can guide our efforts by and come up with your budget strategy based on it.
- Constantly allocate budgets, analyze and recommend modifications to ad spends.
- Collaborate with the design and growth teams to guide A/B creative tests and spend-scaling tests on campaigns, to identify what works best.
- Work with our team and demand new tracking events and anything that can help you optimize campaigns to drive better value for the budget spent, instead of just relying on bringing installs in.
- Test new channels and trends.
  - Such as interactive ads or new platforms like TikTok.
- Have a handle on all our cross-channel paid campaigns and always look for performance. 
  - Our attribution & reporting platforms should be your daily go-to. 
  - Monitor how users acquired from each campaign behave in our product and take strategic actions to lose worst performing campaigns of channels and push best performing ones.
- You’ll have the opportunity to work with our internal team of designers and product people for ad creatives, but having a full-stack orientation and knowledge of design will work great to optimize the way you execute campaigns.
  - Generating ad creatives on your own and being able to fully deliver a paid campaign from start to finish is something we value.

### Our Expectations

- Familiarity with paid campaigns in a variety of channels and products like Google (UAC included), Facebook, Instagram, Apple, Twitter, Quora, Reddit and most likely dozens of others, as you will try to always find new channels that have a great acquisition cost and good user quality to propel us forward.
- Experience with remarketing and retargeting techniques and products (Facebook & Google Dynamic Ads for example).
- Experience with design products for ad creatives.
- Knowledge of Amplitude, Branch, Google Analytics and in general, the mobile paid advertising ecosystem (such as app campaigns, deeplinks, attribution).
- You have good instincts, but you don’t rely on them. You test. And then test again. Data is your daily food and you rely on it to make smarter decisions.
- We are looking for an independent, responsible person. Mainly because there is no time for micro-management. We expect you to be able to carry your own weight and be a reliable partner.
- Over-communicator. Some people may work remotely and it’s up to you to show your work, explain your ideas or highlight problems.
- We want you to be proactive. Words are nice, opinions are cute … but proactivity in action is golden.
- You have a strong business mindset and you're happy to work in a fully English speaking environment.
