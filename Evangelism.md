## How to turn infinite content into knowledge?

### Information Overload — Exhausting, Distractive, Indecisisive…

Are you feeling exhausted scrolling through your daily dose of information overload? You’re not alone. Every US citizen is spending over <u>**13** hours consuming media per day</u>,, [according to a recent report](https://www.emarketer.com/content/time-spent-with-media-overview-2021). And the pandemic only made it worse – increasing the time we spend engaging with digital, social, and traditional media.

> Even if we’re consuming insightful information and not just purposelessly wandering on social media, we end up feeling distracted, indecisive, unproductive, because our cognitive capacities are drained. 

In fact, information overload not only leads to poor personal well-being but is also estimated to <u>result in significant economic losses in the workspaces of around [**$900B** ](https://www.calendar.com/blog/information-overload-is-killing-your-productivity/)every year</u>. And even though one might think that the amount of “screen time” itself is the most serious cause of the problem, [research ](https://www.fastcompany.com/90452741/research-shows-that-screentime-isnt-bad-for-you-but-something-else-may-be)suggests that <u>**at the root of the problem is the content that we choose to consume.**</u> 

**So, what are we to do if we want to change our habits as consumers of information?** 

Well, “becoming a picky eater” and determining what information is truly important, identifying how to find the most precise information to reach your goals, and understanding that the more is not the better when it comes to content consumption seem to be good solutions to the problem. 

### A breath of fresh air in the ocean of misinformation

> “Every year the amount of new content exceeds all the content produced until that year in the whole history of humanity. That applies for books, articles, movies, and TV shows and we think that in a world with pretty much infinite content, curation becomes more important by the day.”

**Curation = the process of filtering content to meet the needs of users, by selecting the right content for them and summarizing the key ideas that resonate with them on an individual level.**

Our social knowledge network app, **Wanderlyf**, brings content creators, curators and consumers together. 

Then, it organizes *lyfs* into *collections* with the goal to create a whole network of infinite learners, who are passionate about personal growth.

> In a world full of news and divisive content and misinformation, an app like ours is like a breath of fresh air.

### Knowledge is the new oil

We believe that having access to better and quick information and putting it in the right place, so it can be accessible just in time, is like a **superpower** for both individuals and organizations. 

> **Knowledge is the new oil**. So having a tool that could keep you organized and give you access to information that would add leverage to everything that you’re doing on a daily basis is what is going to take you to the next level.

There is a lot of beauty and value-added in having access to precise content because this is what improves our cognition. Wanderlyf manifests this by allowing users to quickly bring up on-screen ideas that they have stashed months ago and reconnect with the meaning of this idea. 

Oane highlights that the problem of information overload that Wanderlyf solves is felt at a more emotional level. “I think the people, who are embracing apps like ours, and services like ours, are people who are feeling overwhelmed, or are experiencing a fear of missing out. With all of this information popping up on Messenger, WhatsApp, and Slack, Wanderlyf offers a sort of meditative experience, compared to incumbent social networks,” Oane explains. 



### Big picture insights on content consumption

The medium is the message. A lot of the types of information that we are being exposed to are being influenced by the tools that we have access to. So nowadays everyone carries a phone in their pockets, and we have instant access to entertainment information, which is best optimized for very short, punchy types of content. And I think this is probably here to stay.

We don't expect that in the future people will go back to reading large tomes in the libraries because our attention has already been changed fundamentally.

## Interview: Vladimir Oane, co-founder of Wanderlyf

The young Romanian entrepreneur Vladimir Oane believes his app Wanderlyf can redress our current social-media malaise. Wanderlyf, which Oane founded in 2019, is a ‘social network for content curation’ where ‘stashers’ can summarise key concepts from various sources on topics which interest them. Its website offers ‘career advice’, ‘practical knowledge’ and ‘insipiring [sic] quotes’. Oane believes it to be an example of a new kind of social media, centred around the discussion of ideas, which he solemnly terms the ‘Knowledge Discovery Network’.

Oane says that ‘current mainstream apps encourage showing off more than real connection’, and, more cryptically, that ‘traditional social media also optimises for reaction’. This may well be a reflection of our times. The focus on ‘superficial sharing’ and the current quality of conversation on social media all speak to the fact that we’re ‘in the early days of the internet and digital communication’.

He thinks that the debate around social-media regulation misses the point. ‘Our approach at Wanderlyf is rather than complain and try to get the government to step in and regulate … we want to create different alternatives. If we think that social networks around information and around knowledge can exist, we’re gonna build one’.

Oane tells me that ‘people are going to vote with their time’, and, Thatcherishly, that ‘competition pretty much fixes everything’. By his own admission, Wanderlyf caters to people who take themselves seriously. ‘If you look at my Wanderlyf profile, I’d say you will realise way more about me than if you look at my Linkedin profile or my Facebook page, because there you might see what uni I’ve been to or what my work history is, but if you go to Wanderlyf you will learn about my passion’. He’s willing to bet that shared interests trump shared backgrounds.

This belief extends to that most fraught of topics, contemporary politics. Vladimir tells me that with Wanderlyf ‘we can have a pretty cool conversation which goes well beyond the fact that you voted for a political candidate and I for the opposite. We can still be friends and feel like we have a productive conversation because we are engaging on that level’. It is, of course, also possible to do this in person.

Oane likens Wanderlyf to ‘a brain enhancement pill you have in your phone’ – an analogy which reminds me, among other things, of Elon Musk’s brain interface Neuralink. ‘Pretty much all software in the future is going to be social’, he asserts. ‘We see that in the enterprise, that definitely all consumer apps are going to be social. Even money is going to be social. You can probably look at blockchain as a social experiment in decentralised trust, which requires a lot of people’s involvement’.

Now on a roll, he continues: ‘If information is so abundant, curating that information and making it so that other people you care about on the internet at large can consume it turns curation into an act of creation’. I end by asking Oane to elaborate (further) his thoughts about our changing relationship with knowledge itself. He pauses for a moment, then replies, ‘I think we are going to redefine this pretty soon, and we hope to be part of this redefinition’.

## The solution to a Common Problem

As the pandemic has made life without an electronic device almost impossible, the amount of time one spends on social media, especially while consuming negative news around the virus, has increased dramatically. This is exactly the problem that Wanderlyf tackles. 

We started to realize that the way we spend our attention is kind of how we spend our lives, and I think there is a deep need for more meaningful interactions with good information.

In a nutshell, Dorkodu aims to prevent users from consuming negative content connected to, for example, the pandemic or politics, by providing them with a personalized flow of information in the form of articles, videos, and podcasts, which one can save and share with others, thus enriching his/her knowledge. Every user has an individual home page with content collections organized in different categories such as “Business”, “Society” and “Innovation”. The platform can be modified to show trending stories, content from a specific category, or a combination of categories. Apart from a news feed, a user has his own profile, where all the content he/she has saved is kept. 

## **In the Process of Development**

Wanderlyf is ad-free. According to company claims, the number of users of the platform has passed one million, as it is used in more than 150 countries.

> “We are not at the point where the product is fully baked, there are a lot of things that we are working on, and focusing on early monetization we think can kill our growth.

The money from the seed round is to be used for further development of the platform, as the ambitions of the co-founder are to compete against big players such as Netflix and TikTok, which also offer personalized content. 

We believe that our approach when developing Dorkodu is more of a Silicon Valley-type than European/Asian. Most venture capitals invest in companies that have a developed product and a wild monetization strategy, this is the reason we bootstrapped Dorkodu ourselves, out of our rooms pocket money.

[Wanderlyf](https://wanderlyf.com) is a curated platform of ideas on topics like health & time management, which aims to improve the way users interact with content.

> We are helping our users read smarter and remember more from what they read. We do it through a format we call an idea, a short self-contained note that organizes itself. It's simple, fast, and... fun.
>

**Helping people manage the information overload and giving knowledge workers superpowers.**

We believe trial and error will always out-perform lengthy planning sessions. That’s why they work in short result-oriented sprints. Dorkodu uses sprints not only in product development but across the board by building on top of what works and discarding the rest.

**Wanderlyf allows you to read articles, learn new skills, get tips on productivity, or discover life hacks.**

## Wanderlyf: Self-improvement app for the time poor.

Delivering bite-sized pieces of knowledge on a daily basis.

Wanderlyf curates quality content from across the web and breaks this content down into core ideas.

Wanderlyf straddles the space between educational and self-help. This new app says it is aimed at lifelong learners and is designed to deliver bite-sized nuggets of knowledge to keep the user motivated on a daily basis.

It is essentially a self-improvement app that curates quality content from across the web and breaks this content down into core ideas. Each day, it presents a handful of articles and a handy at-a-glance list of the main themes. So, you can decide to read the article in full and use these core ideas as a quick reference or just do a Cliff’s Notes on it and skip the article completely.

These are the kinds of articles that we tend to save for later but never get around to reading so it’s nice to have them grouped in themes and summarised within a nicely designed app.
